## The props a map is furnished with and a player may hide as: the catalogue that
## `tools/measure_props.gd` measured out of the vendored models.
##
## [b]A size per prop, read from a file, on every machine.[/b] A disguise's hull, its health
## and its hitbox are all functions of the prop's size (see [DotPropDisguise]), and two ends
## computing them from two different measurements would be a predicting client sweeping a
## capsule the server does not have. The server cannot measure anything — a headless process
## has the meshes but no reason to load them — so the size is measured once, offline, into
## `props/catalogue.json`, and everybody reads the number.
##
## [b]Drawn as parts, not as scenes.[/b] A map holds hundreds of props and nearly every one
## is one of a few dozen models, so a client asks [method parts] for a model's meshes and
## their transforms and the map draws each one with a [MultiMeshInstance3D]: a few dozen draw
## calls for a whole school rather than one per chair. A disguised player is drawn with
## [method instance], one scene, because it moves.
