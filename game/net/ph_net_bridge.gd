## [b]What crosses.[/b] A player's own movement is predicted, like every first-person game in
## this family. The map arrives ONCE, as a document in `MAP`; after that what changes is who is
## hiding as what, which is a reliable `DISGUISE` event per change — the hull it implies is
## computed from it on both ends, so a predicting prop sweeps exactly the capsule the server
## does — and the taunts, one `TAUNT` each, played where the prop is on every client.
##
## [b]The ordering is the other half of the file.[/b] dot-net drives simulation per entity;
## this game's tick is a whole-world property — every player moves, then the shots, the taunts
## and the round are decided. [method ensure_game_ticked] reconciles the two: the first
## behaviour through on a tick runs the whole world and the rest find it done.

## costs the server no tick unless the next four are lost too. Over WebSocket nothing is
## ever lost; over ENet (the desktop client, since servers went dual-stack) one command a
## packet was a tick the server ran on the previous command for every packet dropped.
## game-arena measured it first: 80% of ticks with the right command at 20% loss with one
