## The players choose the next map.
##
## [DotVoteDirector] over a [DotVoteListSource] of this server's maps, and the only thing this
## file decides is WHEN: a ballot opens [member open_after_sec] into the LAST round on a map
## ([member due_fn]) and is applied when that round ends, so the next round starts on whatever
## was chosen. Rocking the vote opens one in any round and changes the map at that round's
## end. Everything about the ballot itself (how many options, the counting method, the
## tie-break, nominations, cooldowns) is dot-vote's settings and none of it is restated here;
## [method _rules] only says which of them a few-rounds-per-map game wants by default.
##
## [b]`trigger` is MANUAL, not ROUND_END.[/b] dot-vote's ROUND_END opens a ballot at a round's
## end and applies it at the NEXT round's end, which is a round late. Opening it during the
## last round and applying it at the end (`apply: END_OF_ROUND`) puts the choice on the very
## next round.
##
## [b]Server side only.[/b] A client draws the ballot from the notice [member ballot_fn] sends
## (the client shell's [DotBallotPanel]), and never holds a director: a client that applied a
## result would be deciding what it plays.
